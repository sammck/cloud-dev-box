DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING IN THIS DIRECTORY DIRECTLY
=============================================

This directory contains automatically generated
files for a single pulumi "project" managed by this Git project,
along with all the stacks associated with the pulumi "project".

The contents of this directory are updated each time a pulumi stack
associated with the pulumi "project" is
created or deployed. It represents a snapshot of the most
recent deployment, with enough information to reliably access the
stacks in the pulumi backend.

It should be committed to git after deploying infrastructure,
so that stacks can be subsequently maintained.
